This was my attempt at building, learning, experimenting and creating different ardiuno projects.

Project Details.... Built projects like paraolympic wheel chair, blind man's stick, timely medicine dispenser, Bird feeder, Pipe climber for fire controlling just to name a few.
over the years I have built projects and learnt about Servo motor, accelerometer, bluetooth, RFID, Stepper motor, breadboards, IR sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, LDR.
I have used CorelDRAW, AutoCAD, Ardiuno IDE.

Note: Some of the Project codes cannot be uploaded in the public library of Github.
